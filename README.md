# Code for CS projects given at TJ
This repository contains everything I worked on in the systems lab for the AI, Parallel Computing, and Computer Vision courses. The repository was used to backup my work, so there is no real structure inside each project directory. Don't judge me please :)

Raytracer - parallel2/ray
