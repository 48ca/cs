eye:
ex
ey
ez

we assume z is constant for stuff
z = 0 for every pixel
px = ? looping over all pixels, you know which pixel you're on (scale coords
from 640 to 4 or something)
py = ? (and 480 to 3)
pz = 0
rmag = sqrt(rx + ry + rz)
where rx, ry, and rz are unit vectors for the array
	so a = 1 in the quadratic eq
x = ex + T*rx
y = ey + T*ry
z = ez + T*rz
(x - cx)^2 + (y-cy)^2 + (y-cz)^2 = R^2

substitute x y and z and solve for T w/ quadratic formula
	b^2 - 4ac < 0, background
	has to be done for times
	of those, whichever has smallest T is shown
