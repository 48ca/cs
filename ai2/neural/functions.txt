x as a scalar: (Not)
f(x) = 1 / (1 + e^(-wx + b) )

x as a vector:
f(x) = 1 / (1 + e^(-(wDOTx) + b) )
w is a vector

in other words:
f(x1,x2) = 1 / (1 + e^(-(x1 + x2)*w + b) )

Not
	0 -> 1
	1 -> 0

And
	0, 0 -> 0
	0, 1 -> 0
	1, 0 -> 0
	1, 1 -> 1

Or
	0, 0 -> 0
	0, 1 -> 1
	1, 0 -> 1
	1, 1 -> 1

For Not:
	Sum( Error^2 ) = (f(0) - 1)^2 + (f(1) - 0)^2
